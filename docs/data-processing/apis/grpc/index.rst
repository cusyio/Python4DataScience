gRPC
====

gRPC is a modern, open source, high-performance remote procedure call (RPC)
framework. By default, gRPC uses :doc:`../serialisation-formats/protobuf` as the
Interface Definition Language (IDL) for describing both the service interface
and the structure of the payload messages. In gRPC, a client application can
directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it
were a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications
and services. As in many RPC systems, gRPC is based on the idea of defining a
service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their
parameters and return types. The server implements the interface and runs a gRPC
server to handle client calls; the client has a stub that provides the same
methods as the server.

The following are the main design principles of gRPC:

* gRPC can be created on all common development platforms and in many different
  languages.
* It is designed to work on devices with low CPU and memory capabilities, such
  as Android [#]_ and iOS devices, MicroPython boards and browsers [#]_  [#]_.
* It is licensed under Apache License 2.0 and uses open standards such as HTTP/2
  and Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC).
* gRPC is interoperable and can therefore also be used in the LoRaWan (Long
  Range Wide Area Network), for example.
* The individual layers can be developed independently of each other. For
  example, the transport layer (OSI layer 4) can be developed independently of
  the application layer (OSI layer 7).
* gRPC supports various serialisation formats, including
  :doc:`../serialisation-formats/protobuf`, :doc:`../serialisation-formats/json`
  [#]_, :doc:`../serialisation-formats/xml` and Thrift)
* Asynchronous and synchronous (blocking) processing are supported in most
  languages.
* Streaming of messages in a single RPC call is supported.
* gRPC allows protocol extensions for security, healtch checks, load balancing,
  failover, etc.

Starting with an interface definition in a ``.proto`` file, gRPC provides
Protocol Compiler plugins that generate Client- and Server-side APIs. Both
synchronous and asynchronous communication is supported in most languages. gRPC
also supports streaming of messages in a single RPC call. The `gRPC protocol
<https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md>`_ abstractly
specifies the communication between clients and servers:

#. First the stream is started by the client with a mandatory ``Call Header``

   #. followed by optional ``Initial-Metadata``
   #. followd by optional ``Payload Messages``.

   The contents of ``Call Header`` and ``Initial Metadata`` are sent as HTTP/2
   headers compressed with ``HPACK``.

#. The server answers with an optional ``Initial-Metadata``

   #. followed by ``Payload Messages``
   #. and terminated with mandatory ``Status`` and optional ``Status-Metadata``.

   Payload Messages are serialised into a byte stream fragmented into HTTP/2
   frames. ``Status`` and ``Trailing-Metadata`` are sent as HTTP/2 trailing
   headers.

Unlike Fastapi, however, the gRPC API cannot simply be tested on the command
line with cURL. If necessary, you can use `grpcurl
<https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl>`_. This requires that the gRPC server
supports the `GRPC Server Reflection Protocol
<https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_server-reflection.html>`_. Usually
*Reflection* should only be available in the development phase. Then you can
call grpcurl, e.g. with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ grpcurl localhost:9111 list
