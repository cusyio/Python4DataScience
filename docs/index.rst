Python for Data Science
=======================

This is a tutorial on Data Science with Python. This immediately raises the
question: What is Data Science? The term has become ubiquitous, but there is no
single definition. Some even consider the term superfluous, because what
science does not have to do with data? Nevertheless, it seems to me that data
science is more than just hype: scientific data has become increasingly
voluminous and often can no longer be adequately tapped with conventional
mathematical and statistical methods alone – additional hacking skills are
needed. However, it is not a new field of knowledge that you need to learn, but
a set of skills that you can apply in your field. Whether you are analysing
astronomical objects, analysing machines, forecasting stock prices or working
with data in other fields, the goal of this tutorial is to enable you to solve
tasks programmatically in your field.

This tutorial is not intended to be an introduction to Python or programming in
general; for that there is the :doc:`python-basics:index` tutorial.  Instead, it
is intended to show the Python data science stack – libraries such as
:doc:`/workspace/ipython/index`, :doc:`/workspace/numpy/index`,
:doc:`/workspace/pandas/index`, and related tools – so that you can
subsequently effectively analyse your data. We also offer the `Jupyter Tutorial
<https://jupyter-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ and the `PyViz
Tutorial <https://pyviz-tutorial.readthedocs.io/de/latest/index.html>`_ as well
as the instructions for `data visualisation
<https://www.cusy.design/de/latest/viz/index.html>`_ from the `cusy Design
System <https://www.cusy.design/de/latest/index.html>`_.

All tutorials serve as seminar documents for our harmonised training courses:
