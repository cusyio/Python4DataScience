    "## Careful threading with queues\n",
    "\n",
    "The following rules must be observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All shared resources should be executed in exactly one thread. All communication with this thread should be done with only one atomic message queue – usually with the [queue module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html), email or message queues such as [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) or [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Resources that require this technology include global variables, user inputs, output devices, files, sockets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One category of sequencing problems is to ensure that step A is performed before step B. The solution is to run them both on the same thread, with all the actions happening in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To implement a *barrier* that waits for all parallel threads to complete, just join all threads with <code>join()</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You cannot wait for daemon threads to complete (they are infinite loops); instead you should execute <code>join()</code> on the queue itself, so that the tasks are only merged when all tasks in the queue have been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can use global variables to communicate between functions, but only within a single-threaded program. In a multi-thread program, however, you cannot use global variables because they are mutable. Then the better solution is <code>threading.local()</code>, since it is global in a thread, but not beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Never try to terminate a thread from the outside: you never know if that thread is holding a lock. Therefore, Python does not provide a direct thread termination mechanism. However, if you try to do this with ctypes, this is a recipe for deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
