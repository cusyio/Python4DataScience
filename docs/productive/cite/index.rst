Citing
======

Today software and data are integral parts of scientific research. Software is
used to create, process and analyse research data and to model and simulate
complex processes. Despite their increasing importance in research, itâ€™s little
known how they can be embedded in the scientific recognition and reputation
systems. Quotations are an essential option in these systems, but few researchers
know how software and data could be cited.

Unfortunately, there are no recognised guidelines for software and data
authorship. In addition to the *programmers* role, other roles such as *software
architects*, *technical writers* and *maintainers* can also be defined.
