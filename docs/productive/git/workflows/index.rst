Git workflows
=============

Here, git workflow is understood as a recommendation for using Git to enable a
consistent and efficient way of working. Since Git makes branching and merging
much easier compared to older versioning systems like SVN, this allows for a
variety of different workflows and there is no one ideal process for best
interacting with Git. However, all of the workflows presented expect everyone on
the team to use the same workflow for changes. Therefore, at the outset, a team
should collectively agree on a particular Git workflow that they feel is most
appropriate for that project. Size and team culture play a role in keeping the
complexity of the workflow and the number of errors as low as possible.

In the following, we discuss some of these Git workflows.
