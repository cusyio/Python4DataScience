Manage code with Git
====================

In order to have better control over your source code, it is usually managed
with  `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`. However, I will only briefly explain the
most important terms and provide brief :doc:`installation and configuration
instructions <install-config>`. General introductions to Git are sufficiently
available elsewhere.

    * :download:`Git Cheat Sheet (PDF) <git-cheatsheet-web.pdf>`
    * `Interactive Git Cheatsheet <http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html>`_
    * `Software Carpentry Version Control with Git
      <https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>`_
    * `Flight rules for Git <https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules>`_
    * `First Aid git <http://firstaidgit.io/>`_
    * `Pro Git book <https://git-scm.com/book>`_
    * `Git reference <https://git-scm.com/docs>`_

Essentially, in this tutorial, I show on the one hand how :doc:`Jupyter
Notebooks <first-steps>` can be  managed with Git, and on the other hand
:doc:`best practices <best-practices>` and typical :doc:`workflows/index`.
