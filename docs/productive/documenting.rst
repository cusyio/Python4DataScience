Document
========

So that your product can be used effectively, documentation is required for the
target groups of data scientists and data engineers as well as for system
engineers:

* Data scientists want to see documented

  * which problems your product solves and what the main functions and
    limitations of the software are (``README``)
  * how the product can be used
  * which changes have come in more recent software versions (``CHANGELOG``)

* Data engineers want to know how troubleshooting can help improve the product
  (``CONTRIBUTING``) and how they can communicate with others
  (``CODE_OF_CONDUCT``)
* System engineers need installation instructions for your product and the
  required dependencies

Together, they all need information about how the product is licensed
(``LICENSE`` file or ``LICENSES`` folder and how they can get help if needed.
