``cibuildwheel``
================

``cibuildwheel`` simplifies the creation of :term:`Python Wheels <wheel>` for
the different platforms and Python versions through Continuous Integration (CI)
workflows. More precisely it builds manylinux, macOS 10.9+, and Windows wheels
for CPython and PyPy with GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor,
CircleCI, or GitLab CI.

In addition, it bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through
`auditwheel <https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel>`_ and `delocate
<https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate>`_.

Finally, the tests can also run against the wheels.

GitHub Actions
--------------

To build Linux, macOS, and Windows wheels, create a
``.github/workflows/build_wheels.yml`` file in your GitHub repo:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: Build

    on: [push, pull_request]

    jobs:
      build_wheels:
        name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
        runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
        strategy:
          matrix:
            os: [ubuntu-20.04, windows-2019, macos-10.15]

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Build wheels
            uses: pypa/cibuildwheel@v1.11.0
            # to supply options, put them in 'env', like:
            # env:
            #   CIBW_SOME_OPTION: value

          - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
            with:
              path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl

This runs the CI workflow with the following default settings:

* ``package-dir: .``
* ``output-dir: wheelhouse``

You can extend the file to automatically upload the wheels to the
:term:`Python-Package-Index-PyPI` with:

.. code-block:: yaml

      upload_pypi:
        needs: [build_wheels, build_sdist]
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        # upload to PyPI on every tag starting with 'v'
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && startsWith(github.event.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
        # alternatively, to publish when a GitHub Release is created, use the following rule:
        # if: github.event_name == 'release' && github.event.action == 'published'
        steps:
          - uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
            with:
              name: artifact
              path: dist

          - uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@master
            with:
              user: __token__
              password: ${{ secrets.pypi_password }}
              # To test: repository_url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

Gitlab CI
---------

To build Linux wheels on Gitlab CI, create a ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` file in your
repo:

.. code-block:: yaml

    linux:
      image: python:3.8
      # make a docker daemon available for cibuildwheel to use
      services:
        - name: docker:dind
          entrypoint: ["env", "-u", "DOCKER_HOST"]
          command: ["dockerd-entrypoint.sh"]
      variables:
        DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375/
        DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
        # See https://github.com/docker-library/docker/pull/166
        DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""
      script:
        - curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
        - python -m pip install cibuildwheel==1.11.0
        - cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
      artifacts:
        paths:
          - wheelhouse/
