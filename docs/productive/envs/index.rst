Reproduce environments
======================

Run the notebook in a dedicated environment (e.g. with :doc:`pipenv/index`,
:doc:`devpi` and :doc:`Spack <spack/index>`. Save the file with the
specifications, e.g. ``Pipfile``, ``Pipfile.lock``, ``package-lock.json`` etc.
In this way, you and others can reproduce your calculations and deployment into
the production environment is simplified.
