Create web applications
=======================

I will introduce you to three different types of web applications:

* :doc:`dashboards/index` generated from Jupyter notebooks
* Web applications that go beyond notebooks, such as integrating bokeh plots, as
  demonstrated in :doc:`pyviz:bokeh/embedding-export/flask`
* Finally, the provision of your data via a `RESTful API
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_, e.g. with
  the :doc:`FastAPI framework <../../data/fastapi/index>`.
