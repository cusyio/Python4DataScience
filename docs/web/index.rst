Create web applications
=======================

I will introduce you to three different types of web applications:

* :doc:`jupyter-tutorial:dashboards/index` generated from Jupyter notebooks
* Web applications that go beyond notebooks, such as integrating bokeh plots, as
  demonstrated in :doc:`pyviz:bokeh/embedding-export/flask`
* Finally, the provision of your data via a `RESTful API
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_, for example
  with the :doc:`FastAPI framework <../data-processing/apis/fastapi/index>`.
