Parallelise pandas
==================

In  :doc:`pandas:user_guide/enhancingperf`, some possibilities are described for
improving the performance of pandas. However, there are also special libraries
that can parallelise the processing of data frames.

cuDF
----

cuDF is a GPU DataFrame library that implements a `Pandas-like API
<https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/api.html>`_.

    * `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/cudf/>`_
    * `Example notebooks
      <https://github.com/rapidsai-community/notebooks-contrib>`_

Modin
-----

Modin parallelises almost the entire Pandas API. In most cases, the existing
Pandas code only needs to be extended by the following import:

.. code-block:: python

    import modin.pandas as pd

The restrictions refer to  ``pd.read_json``, which is only implemented for
``lines=True``.

    * `GitHub <https://github.com/modin-project/modin>`_

Dask
----

Dask DataFrame is a large parallel DataFrame made up of multiple Pandas
DataFrames. Here, the  ``dask.dataframe`` API is a subset of the Pandas API,
although there are minor changes.
