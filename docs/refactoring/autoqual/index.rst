Automating code quality
=======================

In the following I would like to introduce some tools and concepts that simplify
the maintenance of Python packages and other source code. Together with
:doc:`/productive/git/pre-commit`, they can be used to automatically check and
improve the code quality.

Checker
-------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   flake8
   manifest
   mypy

Formatter
