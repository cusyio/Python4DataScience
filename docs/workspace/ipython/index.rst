IPython
=======

`IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_, or *Interactive Python*, was initially an
advanced Python interpreter that has now grown into an extensive project
designed to provide tools for the entire life cycle of research computing.
Today, IPython is not only an interactive interface to Python, but also offers a
number of useful syntactic additions for the language. In addition, IPython is
closely related to the `Jupyter project <https://jupyter.org/>`_.
