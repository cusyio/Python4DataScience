pandas
======

`pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_  is a Python library used for processing
data sets. It has functions for analysing, cleaning, manipulating and
visualising data. With pandas, we can analyse large amounts of data and draw
conclusions based on statistical theories. For example, we can use pandas to
check whether there are correlations between two or more columns, what the
average, maximum and minimum values are. Further possibilities of pandas are:

* fast and efficient processing and analysis of data
* inserting and deleting columns in tables and higher-dimensional objects
* merging and connecting data sets
* Condense and simplify data and display it in pivot tables.
* powerful grouping functions to perform split-apply-combine operations.

This has made pandas one of the most important libraries for data science.
